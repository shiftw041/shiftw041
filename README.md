# Hi, I am shiftw👋 ![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=shiftw041&color=blue&style=flat-square)
## About Me
My name is Wu Xuefei, a senior in school of Cyber Science and Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

I am enthusiastic about the prospect of furthering my studies in China.I have a clear interest as well as some research foundation in the field of **efficient AI**, and I'd like to study usable algorithms in real systems. Also, I am equally open and curious about unfamiliar research areas. I believe that through further study and continuous learning, I can make continuous progress on the path of scientific research and explore more possibilities.

I am looking forward to joining a research group that aligns with me and embarking on my graduate studies, climbing the academic summit together with like-minded peers.
